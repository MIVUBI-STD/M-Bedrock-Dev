# Orchestrator

`packages/orchestrator` is the composition layer for cross-owner Bedrock inspection, diagnosis, repair admission, runtime evidence, reporting, reliability workflows, and release-oriented decisions.

It is expected to have higher fan-out than ordinary engine modules because it composes analyzers and deterministic package owners. High fan-out alone is not a reason to create another package, but orchestration is not permission to absorb reusable domain semantics.

## Internal navigation

The public surface is `src/index.ts`, but it now routes through family entrypoints instead of exporting hundreds of flat implementation modules directly.

```text
src/
├── core/index.ts
├── inspection/index.ts
├── arena/index.ts
├── diagnosis/index.ts
├── repair/index.ts
├── reliability/index.ts
├── reporting/index.ts
├── workflow/index.ts
├── release/index.ts
└── index.ts
```

These family barrels are the canonical navigation hierarchy for orchestrator.

## File responsibility and navigation

The user-facing selected-map flow is `TARGET → DISCOVERY → UNDERSTAND → MODEL → STRESS → PROVE → REPORT`. These are **workflow stages**, not additional source directories or alternate semantic owners. Navigate stages through the existing canonical `docs/system/implementation-map.md` and the audit workflow; implementation remains owned by the responsible family/package/analyzer.

- The root production `map-audit-*.ts` files own specific audit coordination, admission, or projections, not generic Minecraft analysis.
- Family `src/<family>/<responsibility>.ts` files own their declared orchestration concern. A family index is a navigation/export surface, not a second implementation.
- Flat root re-exports are legacy compatibility paths, never the preferred implementation or a new source of truth.
- When a name does not match its implementation, prove the actual owner and affected imports before renaming or moving it.
- One authoritative result contract per production flow; derived report formats must not create parallel state or approval authority.

## Compatibility alias rule

Legacy flat `src/*.ts` re-export stubs are compatibility-only. They are not canonical owners.

Rules:

- new code imports from the family path (`inspection/`, `diagnosis/`, `repair/`, etc.);
- do not add new flat root re-export stubs;
- do not duplicate implementation behind an alias;
- remove legacy aliases only in a verified import-migration pass.

This keeps current work practical without a risky mass-delete while CI/local verification is deferred.

## Physical layout

Canonical implementations live under the family directories above. Legacy flat source paths are compatibility re-export stubs only and must not receive new implementation logic.

## Production selected-map audit boundary

Production gameplay bug audit has one operator entry, one authority, and one stage order:

```text
audit <selected-map>
→ runSelectedMapAudit({ artifactPath })
→ TARGET
→ DISCOVERY
→ UNDERSTAND
→ MODEL
→ STRESS
→ PROVE
→ REPORT
```

Blocking does not fork the workflow. It stops authorization at the first unresolved stage and resumes the same `SelectedMapAuditRun` through its single allowed continuation.

`inspectArtifact()` and the inspection family are engineering primitives used by the canonical audit, reliability tooling, comparison, repair verification, and focused engine development. They are not alternate production audit entry points. The sole production CLI command is `audit`. Engineering-only `dev-*` projections may reuse the canonical audit snapshot but cannot authorize production decisions.

Repository verification enforces this boundary through `verify:audit-entrypoint`.

## Inspection pipeline

`inspect.ts` is the internal inspection composition flow used underneath the canonical audit. Detailed work is delegated to bounded stages:

```text
filesystem inventory
→ inspect-packs
→ inspect-source-index
→ inspect-graph-enrichment
→ inspect-script-import-graph
→ inspect-script-compatibility
→ inspect-entity-knowledge-stage
→ inspect-runtime-analysis-stage
→ knowledge runtime composition
→ inspect-education-stage
→ inspect-causality-stage
→ inspect-result
```

Supporting pure helpers:

```text
inspect-identifiers
inspect-runtime-evidence
```

## Stage rule

Create or extract an inspection stage only when all of these are true:

- it owns one coherent transformation or analysis concern;
- its inputs and outputs can be stated explicitly;
- it reduces direct coupling or control-flow noise in `inspect.ts`;
- it does not duplicate an analyzer/package semantic owner;
- it can be validated through the existing integrated inspection tests.

Do not create stages merely to reduce line count.

## Extraction gate

Before adding another orchestrator module, ask:

```text
Does this only compose existing owners?
  yes → orchestrator may own it

Does it define reusable semantics/policy/state/mutation?
  yes → move it to the canonical package/analyzer owner

Is it consumer/UI-specific?
  yes → apps/tooling owns it, not orchestrator
```

Keep the source layout shallow when path stability is materially valuable. Introduce a physical subdirectory only for a cohesive family with a stable boundary; do not mass-move files merely for appearance.

## Boundaries

Orchestrator may compose analyzers and core packages. It must not:

- become the canonical parser for Bedrock formats;
- duplicate compatibility, graph, repair, diagnostic, or knowledge semantics;
- hide mutable global state;
- create interface-specific behavior for CLI/MCP/UI;
- treat static/package evidence as runtime proof;
- expose a user-facing production path that bypasses `runSelectedMapAudit()`.

`inspect.ts` should remain readable as a top-to-bottom composition flow. Detailed parsing, derivation, diagnostics, and result projection belong in the nearest bounded stage or their existing semantic owner.

## Projection boundary

New consumers should not use `gameplayWorld` as their primary model.

```text
gameplaySemantic
→ gameplay meaning, subjects, arena structure, authored systems

engineeringAssessment
→ capacity, lifecycle convergence, cleanup, isolation, proof, contract/runtime gaps

gameplayWorld
→ deprecated compatibility composite only
```

This prevents QA state from becoming gameplay meaning and prevents inferred gameplay structure from being treated as engineering proof.
