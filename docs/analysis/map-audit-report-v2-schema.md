# Map Audit Report V2 Schema

## Purpose

Defines the **Map Audit Report** used by humans after selected-map analysis. This is the honest report surface and must preserve every material finding, whether `PROVEN` or `NEED_VALIDATION`.

The report engine must first try to resolve NEED_VALIDATION toward PROVEN using the bounded proof route. If deciding proof remains unavailable, the finding stays visible as NEED_VALIDATION; it must never be dropped merely because it is not yet proven.

## Required audit model

```text
World Artifact
→ Evidence Scope
→ Gameplay Surface Inventory
→ Gameplay Discovery Closure
→ Game Design Model
→ Gameplay Flow + State Closure
→ Boundary / Multi Arena / Capacity / Replica Model
→ Reachability + Capability Exposure
→ Blind-Spot + Cross-System Coverage
→ Gameplay Model Closure
→ BUG Findings
→ DESIGN_MISMATCH Findings
→ Coverage Accounting
→ Closure-gated Production Report
```

## Evidence scope

Current gameplay conclusions must come from the selected artifact only.

The output records:
- selected artifact;
- selected-map-version-only mode;
- archive sources not used as current gameplay authority.

## Game design model

Required understanding:
- objective;
- win condition;
- lose condition;
- reset rules;
- preserve rules;
- progression rules;
- multiplayer rules;
- multi-arena/capacity rules when applicable.

## Coverage accounting

Every applicable audit surface is recorded as:

- checked;
- blocked, with reason; or
- not-applicable, with reason.

Unsupported or unparsed mechanics remain internal detection-gap reasons and must project publicly as NEED_VALIDATION with exact missing proof and one narrow validation test.

## Canonical issue taxonomy

Every reportable finding is described on four independent axes:

```text
Issue Type
+ Gameplay Flow
+ Failure Domain
+ Severity
```

### Issue Type

- `BUG`
- `DESIGN_MISMATCH`

### Gameplay Flow

- `ENTRY_JOIN`
- `READY_START`
- `SETUP`
- `ACTIVE_GAMEPLAY`
- `PROGRESSION`
- `TERMINAL`
- `CLEANUP_REPLAY`
- `RECOVERY`

### Failure Domain

- `arena-multi-arena`
- `inventory-economy`
- `progression-wave-objective`
- `chunk-simulation`
- `player-lifecycle`
- `entity-ai-combat`
- `world-structure-mutation`
- `ui-feedback-information`
- `state-ownership`
- `temporal-async`
- `boundary-capacity`
- `persistence-recovery`
- `platform-performance`

`failureDomain` is the primary reader-facing domain. `contributingDomains[]` preserves materially involved cross-system domains for the same root cause.

### Severity

Severity remains independent from issue type/domain and is derived from actual impact:

- Blocker
- Major
- Minor

Do not infer severity merely because an issue belongs to multi-arena, inventory, UI, or another domain.

## Issue type split

Map Audit Output V2 has two distinct issue-type lanes. Each lane may contain PROVEN or NEED_VALIDATION findings; unresolved material findings must remain visible until resolved or disproved.

### BUG

Use when the selected artifact has a grounded intended behavior/design, but implementation or runtime behavior breaks that intent.

Examples:

- spawn should happen but fails;
- reconnect should restore loadout but does not;
- purchase consumes currency but fails to deliver effect;
- cleanup leaves stale state that corrupts the next run.

### DESIGN_MISMATCH

Use when the capability/design presented by the map does not match what can actually be played or delivered, even if the implementation is internally consistent.

Examples:

- six arenas are presented but only two can run concurrently;
- a visible mechanic or route is offered but the supported capability is materially lower;
- platform/resource constraints make the authored design undeliverable as presented.

Technical constraints are recorded as root cause/constraint evidence. They do not convert a DESIGN_MISMATCH into normal behavior.

A finding must belong to exactly one of these two lanes. Do not duplicate one root cause into both.

## BUG record

Every reportable issue requires:

```text
Bug ID
Issue Type
Failure Domain
Contributing Domains
Gameplay Flow
Status
Issue
Player Impact
Reproduction Steps
Expected Behavior
Actual Behavior
Evidence
Proof Ceiling
```

PROVEN findings require:
- cleared counter-evidence;
- tester-ready reproduction.

Blocker / Major / Minor severity is included only after impact classification is grounded. Severity becomes mandatory when a PROVEN BUG is promoted into approved Bug Report V2; the Map Audit Report must not invent severity merely to satisfy presentation.

## DESIGN_MISMATCH record

DESIGN_MISMATCH uses the same evidence, gameplay-flow, severity, reproduction, expected/actual, proof-ceiling, and counter-evidence discipline as BUG.

Additional fields may include:

```text
Mismatch Kind
Technical Constraint
Presented Capability
Playable Capability
```

## Canonical unresolved-proof fields

Every public NEED_VALIDATION finding uses the same names:

```text
validationReason
missingProof
validationTest
validationGroupKey
proofNavigation
```

`proofNavigation` may expose:

```text
proofGoal
provenClaims[]
missingClaims[]
route[]
evidenceSubstitutions[]
historicalSearchHints[]
historyPressure
familyProofCriteria[]
proofStopRule
runtimeLastResort
```

These are proof-navigation fields, not additional public statuses.

Map-level audit output also carries:

```text
validationTests[]
honesty
qualityGates.vitalGameplay
qualityGates.informationIntegrity
qualityGates.zeroFinding
fullMapReplica
```

The quality gates are projections over the same canonical audit state. They do not create new finding lanes, new gameplay authority, or a second audit state machine.

- `vitalGameplay` projects exactly eight vital domains and is `CLOSED` only when every applicable domain is `UNDERSTOOD_PROVEN_SAFE`, `UNDERSTOOD_WITH_FINDING`, or `NOT_APPLICABLE`. `RUNTIME_REQUIRED`, `DETECTION_GAP`, or unrouted material residue keeps it `OPEN`.
- `informationIntegrity` is `CLOSED_CLEAR`, `CLOSED_WITH_FINDINGS`, or `BLOCKED`. Any contradiction remains exactly once in `bugs[]` or `designMismatches[]`.
- `zeroFinding` is `ELIGIBLE`, `NOT_ELIGIBLE`, or `NOT_APPLICABLE`. It may be ELIGIBLE only when both finding lanes are empty and canonical coverage/closure/honesty are fully closed with no remaining Audit Obligations or validation groups.

The canonical Map Audit Output V2 preserves every material finding in exactly two issue-type lanes:

```text
bugs[]
designMismatches[]
```

Each lane may contain both `PROVEN` and `NEED_VALIDATION`.

Internal/report-build APIs may expose convenience projections such as `findings`, `proven`, or `needValidation`, but those are not additional Map Audit Output V2 authorities.

`NEED_VALIDATION` items must remain visible until they are either promoted to `PROVEN` by sufficient proof or independently disproved. They must never disappear merely because they are not yet approved bugs.

`fullMapReplica` uses only:

```text
replicaBaseline
replicaResults[]
replicaId
replicaStatus
replicaDivergenceIds[]
incompleteReplicaIds[]
baselineReusableForAllReplicas
```

## Human-facing report completeness

The Map Audit Report must render all material findings:

```text
PROVEN BUG
PROVEN DESIGN_MISMATCH
NEED_VALIDATION BUG
NEED_VALIDATION DESIGN_MISMATCH
```

Rules:

- try to promote NEED_VALIDATION through source/cross-domain/formal/counter-proof routes first;
- keep unresolved findings visible when proof is still missing;
- show `validationReason`, `missingProof`, and `validationTest` for NEED_VALIDATION;
- do not assign final Blocker/Major/Minor severity to NEED_VALIDATION;
- do not invent severity for PROVEN findings before grounded impact classification;
- do not convert NEED_VALIDATION into PROVEN merely to make the report look complete;
- do not omit a material finding from the human-facing report because it is not eligible for the approved bug ledger.

## Status

Every material finding uses exactly one of two public statuses:

- `PROVEN` — contradiction is sufficiently proven from selected-artifact evidence and blocking counter-proof is cleared. Final Blocker / Major / Minor severity is allowed.
- `NEED_VALIDATION` — the finding remains materially plausible but one specific proof obligation is unresolved. It must include a concise validation reason, the exact missing proof, and one narrow validation test. Final severity is not allowed yet.

BUG versus DESIGN_MISMATCH remains an independent `issueType`; status does not replace issue type.

Internal states such as RUNTIME_PROOF_REQUIRED, DETECTION_GAP, COUNTERPROOF_SEARCH_REQUIRED, GAMEPLAY_TRANSLATION_REQUIRED, insufficient evidence, or ambiguous intent are mapped into NEED_VALIDATION fields and never exposed as additional public statuses.


## Gameplay Model Closure

- `CLOSED` — discovered surfaces are accounted and material state/boundary understanding is complete.
- `PARTIAL` — discovered surfaces are accounted, but explicitly identified material evidence remains blocked/unknown.
- `OPEN` — one or more discovered surfaces are unaccounted, the major state model is incomplete, or material boundaries are not sufficiently extracted.

`OPEN` may contain non-empty `unaccountedSurfaceIds` and blocks comprehensive production review/publication.

## Advanced coverage

When applicable, coverage includes:

- replica integrity/completeness;
- prerequisite reachability;
- sensitive capability exposure/authorization;
- negative-space and mechanic completeness;
- temporal/cross-system risk;
- repeated-run baseline/reset proof;
- player-facing evidence;
- quantitative/platform constraints.


## Publication precondition

Gameplay Discovery Closure is a production control gate and does not create a second persisted report authority.

Before Map Audit Output V2 is treated as comprehensive:

- Gameplay Discovery Closure must be `COMPLETE`; both `OPEN` and `PARTIAL` block publication.
- Gameplay Model Closure must be `CLOSED`; both `OPEN` and `PARTIAL` block publication.

If either closure is not fully closed, the human-facing report may still expose the honest partial finding set and exact unresolved obligations, but it must not claim comprehensive audit completion.
## Optional cross-domain reasoning metadata

A BUG or DESIGN_MISMATCH finding may carry an optional `reasoning` object when canonical causal-link reasoning passes evidence admission. This metadata does not create a new finding status or repair authority.

Canonical fields:

```text
reportClassification
diagnosticDisposition
proofConfidence
evidenceDomainSources[]
evidenceChain[]
unresolvedPredicates[]
recommendedValidationPredicate
recommendedReadOnlyProbeId
```

`reportClassification` is explanatory report vocabulary only. The canonical public finding status remains `PROVEN` or `NEED_VALIDATION`, and BUG versus DESIGN_MISMATCH remains the canonical issue type. Missing or rejected reasoning must not remove the underlying finding.
