# Script API Static Analysis

Script content is analyzed statically and is never executed.

## Current facts

The analyzer extracts:

- ES module imports;
- @minecraft/* module usage;
- relative script dependencies;
- world and system references;
- beforeEvents / afterEvents subscriptions;
- system.afterEvents.scriptEventReceive subscriptions;
- dynamic property API calls;
- literal dynamic-property IDs when statically visible.

Microsoft documents World event collections and System event collections as first-class Script API surfaces, and system.afterEvents.scriptEventReceive is the event raised by /scriptevent. citeturn771857search0turn771857search1turn771857search4

Microsoft also separates Script API module versions into stable, beta, and internal tracks; beta APIs do not carry stable backwards-compatibility guarantees and require Beta APIs experiment enablement. citeturn771857search2

## Analysis boundary

The analyzer does not execute code or attempt full program evaluation.

```text
source text
→ TypeScript parser AST
→ syntactic semantic facts
→ module graph / capability facts
→ diagnostics
```

Computed property names, runtime-generated imports, reflective behavior, and arbitrary data flow remain unknown unless a dedicated static analysis later proves them.

## Dynamic properties

Dynamic-property use is tracked by operation and literal property ID when available. Computed IDs remain present as an access with unknown ID.

This supports future correlation with world DB dynamic-property records without making DB semantics part of the script parser.

## Compatibility model

Script API compatibility is evaluated through separate evidence lanes rather than one guessed version flag:

```text
module / track
symbol lifecycle
receiver inference
call signature
return contract
property mutability
enum backing value
execution privilege
observed usage
```

Unknown dynamic/computed behavior remains unknown unless bounded static analysis proves it.

## Module and track

Distinguish:
- stable;
- beta / prerelease;
- internal / experimental;
- unknown.

A recognized symbol is not automatically valid for the module version declared by the pack.

## Symbol lifecycle

Methods, events, receiver properties, enum members, and imported types may be:

```text
active
deprecated
removed
unknown
```

Lifecycle is distinct from call-signature or return-contract changes.

Unknown identifiers are not assumed compatible or incompatible.

## Symbol/version matrix

Availability is evaluated at symbol granularity.

Examples of covered evidence classes include:
- event symbols;
- direct singleton methods;
- bounded receiver-backed methods/properties;
- named-import enum members;
- imported types.

Receiver inference is intentionally bounded to evidence-backed flows such as direct world/dimension results, scoreboard surfaces, supported array element flow, simple local helper returns, and explicit supported receiver annotations.

This is not a general TypeScript type checker.

## Signature migrations

A surviving symbol may change accepted arguments.

The analyzer retains:
- argument count;
- coarse argument kinds;
- spread presence;
- canonical receiver;
- source location.

Deterministic mismatches may produce compatibility diagnostics. Ambiguous spread/dynamic call shapes remain unknown.

## Return contracts

Some APIs remain available while their result becomes optional or otherwise changes safety requirements.

Analyze result use such as:

```text
ignored
assigned
returned
dereferenced
optional-dereferenced
non-null-asserted
guarded-assigned
unguarded-assigned
```

Recognize only bounded local guards that are structurally provable. Reassignment or arbitrary interprocedural flow ends that proof.

## Property and enum compatibility

Treat separately:
- writable → readonly transitions;
- property availability/lifecycle;
- enum member lifecycle;
- enum backing-value changes when explicit literal comparisons make the value semantically relevant.

A changed backing value is different from a removed enum member.

## Execution privilege

Separate:
- early/startup execution;
- restricted before-event execution;
- default after-event execution;
- custom-command/restricted callback contexts when evidence exists.

A syntactically valid mutation can still be illegal in its execution privilege.

Unknown methods are not assumed safe merely because no restricted-execution rule exists.

## Usage inventory

Per-map and portfolio inspection should retain observed Script API usage by symbol kind and evidence quality.

Useful fields include:
- occurrence count;
- source files;
- known vs unclassified state;
- receiver inference quality;
- lifecycle metadata;
- call-shape distribution;
- result-use distribution;
- relevant enum literal-comparison distribution.

Observed-but-unclassified symbols are knowledge backlog, not map defects.

Promotion into compatibility knowledge requires:
1. correct parser classification;
2. authoritative version/lifecycle provenance;
3. the smallest evidence-backed rule;
4. regression coverage.

## Noise control

Do not double-count semantic surfaces already owned elsewhere.

For example, event-container properties such as `world.beforeEvents` and `world.afterEvents` are represented through event subscriptions rather than generic property usage.

Aliases from named imports should resolve to canonical symbols where statically provable. Dynamic namespace/computed access remains unclassified.

## Static coverage boundary

Do not expand static compatibility into domains it cannot prove:

- runtime-generated/reflection-style access;
- arbitrary interprocedural type flow;
- semantic behavior changes with identical syntax;
- engine scheduling;
- chunk/simulation timing;
- entity AI;
- multiplayer interleavings;
- native-world behavior.

Those route to selected-artifact, differential, runtime, or live-game evidence.

## Completion rule

Static Script API coverage is complete only relative to the current evidence-backed rule set and observed usage.

New rules are usage/evidence driven. Do not create speculative API matrices solely for apparent completeness.
