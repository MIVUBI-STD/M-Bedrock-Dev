# Bug Tracker UI Contract

This document is the canonical presentation contract for Approved Bug Report V2 tracker output.

It governs human-facing HTML only. Canonical BUG, DESIGN_MISMATCH, DEV_NOTE, source binding, version, evidence, and technical facts remain owned by their existing repository authorities.

## Goal

The report must make the normal workflow obvious without explanation:

```text
open report
→ identify map / level / version
→ find a finding
→ understand the problem
→ run Test In-Game
→ compare with Expected
→ mark Passed or Failed
→ optionally add notes/evidence
→ Save as HTML
```

Developer flow uses the same finding:

```text
problem
→ Technical Details
→ evidence
→ technical explanation
→ relevant code
→ recommended fix
→ must-preserve boundary
```

Every visible element must help navigation, understanding, testing, debugging, or saving. Otherwise it does not belong in HTML.

## Language

All generated report UI vocabulary is English.

Use one presentation term per concept:

| Concept | UI term |
| --- | --- |
| gameplay test | Test In-Game |
| correct observable behavior | Expected |
| tester outcome | Passed / Failed |
| unresolved proof | Needs Validation |
| developer detail disclosure | Technical Details |
| fix direction | Recommended Fix |
| tester free text | Tester Notes |
| historical retained version | archive/vX.Y.Z |

Do not reintroduce presentation synonyms such as How to Reproduce, Mark Fixed, Needs Verify, Resolution, Success, or Done.

Storage field names are not renamed merely to match presentation labels.

## Two presentation scopes

### Map Report — default

A document containing one game renders as a Map Report.

It does not render Maps navigation or a game accordion.

Hierarchy:

```text
Bug Tracker Report
Map
Version / Levels
Summary
Level / Source
Bugs
Design Mismatches
Developer Notes
```

For multi-level games:

```text
Game
├── Level 1
│   ├── Source
│   ├── Bugs
│   ├── Design Mismatches
│   └── Developer Notes
└── Level 2
    └── same lane order
```

### Combined Report — briefing

A document containing multiple games renders as a Combined Report.

It adds global Summary, Maps navigation, and collapsible game sections.

Maps use column-major numbering: numbers read downward in the first column before continuing at the top of the second column.

Combined mode is a briefing/navigation presentation, not a second canonical report authority.

## Lane order

Within every level, lane order is fixed:

1. Bugs
2. Design Mismatches
3. Developer Notes

Empty lanes are omitted from HTML.

Each lane has independent visual numbering starting at 01. Canonical IDs remain the real identity.

DEV_NOTE is reference information. It has no gameplay severity and no Passed/Failed control.

## Finding hierarchy

Collapsed gameplay finding:

```text
number · severity · verification · optional tester result
title
problem
canonical ID
Test / Details
```

Expanded gameplay finding:

```text
Test In-Game       only when canonical reproduction exists
Expected           only when canonical expected behavior exists
Test Result
Tester Notes       optional workspace state
Evidence           optional workspace state
Technical Details  only when technical content exists
```

Technical Details order:

1. Observed Behavior / Evidence
2. Why It Happens / Technical Analysis
3. Relevant Code
4. Recommended Fix
5. Must Preserve

Missing canonical information stays missing. The renderer must never invent reproduction, expected behavior, cause, evidence, code ownership, or a fix to make the card look complete.

## Interaction states

Card color communicates tester interaction state; badges communicate canonical classification.

- default: white;
- open: blue left rail + blue border + subtle blue header;
- Passed: green result treatment;
- Failed: red result treatment.

Verification remains visible after Passed/Failed because verification and tester result answer different questions.

Severity colors:

- Blocker: red;
- Major: amber;
- Minor: neutral gray.

Verification colors:

- Verified Issue: subtle green;
- Needs Validation: amber.

Do not use blue for Minor; blue is reserved for active/interacting UI.

## Readability

Desktop is the current presentation target.

- report width: approximately 1080 px;
- narrative text width: approximately 760–850 px;
- body/problem/test text: approximately 12 px with ~1.5 line height;
- issue title: approximately 14 px;
- metadata and IDs: approximately 8–9 px;
- canonical IDs use monospace;
- text is left aligned;
- textarea background is white;
- keyboard focus remains visibly outlined.

Use a small spacing scale (4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 px) instead of one-off values.

Do not add charts, sidebars, gradients, decorative animation, dashboard widgets, or icon libraries unless a demonstrated workflow problem requires them.

## Tester workspace and Save

Tester workspace state is not canonical issue state.

Persist only useful working data:

- Passed / Failed;
- Tester Notes;
- evidence attachments and captions;
- Developer Notes free text.

Do not persist hover state, disclosure state, scroll position, or other presentation-only state.

Changes auto-save to browser-local workspace state.

Primary portable action is **Save as HTML**. It creates a new self-contained HTML copy containing current tester workspace state. It does not overwrite the generated canonical `output/bug-tracker.html`.

Secondary actions:

- Save JSON;
- Load JSON;
- Reset Tester Data.

Use Save, not Export, in tester-facing UI.

## HTML / JSON parity

HTML and `bug-tracker.json` are projections of the same validated BugTrackerDocument.

Every canonical BUG, DESIGN_MISMATCH, and DEV_NOTE ID must appear exactly once in both projection domains. The renderer must not create, duplicate, or omit canonical findings.

Tester workspace state may be included in a saved portable HTML/JSON copy, but it never mutates canonical issue facts.

## Regression requirements

Repository tests must protect at least:

- one-game document renders Map Report without Maps navigation;
- multi-game document renders Combined Report with Maps navigation;
- combined Maps navigation is column-major;
- lane order is Bugs → Design Mismatches → Developer Notes;
- empty lanes do not render;
- lane numbering is independent;
- Passed and Failed controls exist;
- Mark Fixed and Export do not return;
- Technical Details only render from available canonical data;
- unknown information is omitted rather than synthesized;
- Developer Notes remain a separate reference lane;
- HTML/JSON canonical-ID parity remains exact.

## Change rule

Do not add a visible field because it might be useful.

Before adding UI, prove that it helps at least one of:

1. find something;
2. understand a finding;
3. run a test;
4. debug/fix the problem;
5. save/continue tester work.

If it does none of these, keep it out of HTML.
