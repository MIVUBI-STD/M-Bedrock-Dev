# Implementation Map

Human-readable routing map for implementation ownership.

This file is intentionally high-level. It is **not** a manually maintained database of every source file or symbol.

Exact implementation lookup follows:

```text
Task / concern
→ Router
→ Resource Catalog
→ ownership.json
→ targeted source lookup
```

Machine-readable ownership and current source win if this overview becomes stale.

## Engine domains

| Concern | Canonical implementation owner |
|---|---|
| Artifact identity / fingerprint | `engine/packages/artifact/` |
| Archive / ZIP safety and deterministic transport | `engine/packages/archive/` |
| Shared dependency-neutral primitives | `engine/packages/common/` |
| Project/workspace/session models | `engine/packages/project-model/` |
| Semantic dependency graph / invalidation | `engine/packages/graph/` |
| Semantic execution/state representation | `engine/packages/semantic-ir/` |
| Parser-independent value/data flow | `engine/packages/dataflow/` |
| Platform knowledge contracts/applicability | `engine/packages/knowledge/` + `engine/knowledge/` |
| Gameplay intent / selected-artifact expected behavior | `engine/packages/gameplay-intent/` |
| Behavioral state/transition/temporal model | `engine/packages/behavior-model/` |

Canonical package grouping is machine-readable in:

```text
engine/packages/ownership.json
```

## Analyzer domains

| Concern | Canonical analyzer owner |
|---|---|
| File/content discovery | `engine/analyzers/discovery/` |
| Manifest semantics | `engine/analyzers/manifest/` |
| mcfunction parsing | `engine/analyzers/functions/` |
| Command semantics | `engine/analyzers/commands/` |
| Script / TypeScript semantics | `engine/analyzers/scripts/` |
| Dialogue semantics | `engine/analyzers/dialogue/` |

| Spatial/topology analysis | `engine/analyzers/topology/` |
| Native world DB evidence | `engine/analyzers/world-db/` |
| Derived diagnostics | `engine/analyzers/diagnostics/` |

Canonical grouping:

```text
engine/analyzers/ownership.json
engine/adapters/ownership.json
```

## Data and evidence owners

| Data | Canonical owner |
|---|---|
| Minecraft platform/runtime facts | `engine/knowledge/` |
| Engineering contracts | `engine/contracts/engineering/` |
| Reliability catalogs | `engine/reliability/catalogs/` |
| Frozen evaluation corpus | `engine/reliability/corpus/` |
| Historical execution evidence | `engine/reliability/history/` |
| Regression fixtures | `engine/fixtures/regressions/` |
| Current project continuity | `workspace/projects/` |
| Current Bug Report V2 | `workspace/projects/<project-id>/report/` (or level-scoped report) |
| Current Developer Notes | `workspace/projects/<project-id>/report/developer-notes.json` (or level-scoped report) |
| Work intent | `planning/` |

## Flow-to-owner navigation

A workflow stage is a navigation label, not a second implementation owner. Start with the production flow, then follow the canonical implementation owner and its output contract. Never create a duplicate module or alias to make a stage name match a path.

| Selected-map audit concern | Workflow coordination | Semantic implementation responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| TARGET | `engine/packages/orchestrator/src/map-audit-pipeline.ts` and `map-audit-user-intent.ts` | Selected artifact identity and project-model; current selected artifact is the authority |
| DISCOVERY | `engine/packages/orchestrator/src/inspection/inspect.ts` under the production pipeline | `engine/analyzers/discovery/` plus format-specific adapters and analyzers |
| UNDERSTAND | Production pipeline composes inspection and gameplay evidence | `engine/packages/gameplay-intent/` and relevant authored-source analyzers |
| MODEL | Production pipeline consumes evidence-backed models | `engine/packages/behavior-model/`, `semantic-ir/`, and `graph/` within their distinct contracts |
| STRESS | Production pipeline coordinates cross-domain checks | Existing analyzer, diagnosis, and reliability owners according to the specific invariant |
| PROVE | `map-audit-admission.ts`, the audit proof/honesty projections | Canonical evidence and diagnostic owners; no static-to-runtime promotion |
| REPORT | `map-audit-output-v2.ts` and `reporting/report-defect-collector.ts` | `engine/packages/bug-report/` for separately approved bugs |

The table routes investigation; it does not claim that each stage is completely implemented, equate stage output with persisted truth, or override the precise contracts in the Master Selected-Map Audit Workflow and the current source.

For SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT, start from `AGENTS.md` and the owning development skill, locate the first incorrect implementation owner here, fix it in place, and verify the affected consumers. Development is not another Map Audit stage.

### One source, one meaning, one authoritative output

- **One source:** each semantic fact or behavior has one canonical implementation/data owner. An export barrel is an API surface, not a new owner.
- **One meaning:** file and folder names must describe their actual responsibility. If an implementation combines unrelated responsibilities, separate only where an existing owner and consumers prove the boundary.
- **One output authority:** each production workflow has one authoritative result contract. Derived HTML/JSON, report previews, search indexes and compatibility exports are views, not competing output truth.
- **No new aliases:** canonical internal imports go directly to their owning family. Legacy re-export paths are compatibility debt, not acceptable destinations for new imports.
- **Safe retirement:** do not delete compatibility paths until internal, tooling, test, and external/deep-import contracts are accounted for. No mass renaming solely to mirror a user-facing stage.

## Critical selected-map audit entrypoints

These exact source entrypoints are intentionally listed because they define production workflow authority.

| Responsibility | Source owner |
|---|---|
| Production selected-map audit entry / continuation | `engine/packages/orchestrator/src/map-audit-pipeline.ts` |
| User intent / pre-audit confirmation | `engine/packages/orchestrator/src/map-audit-user-intent.ts` |
| Ordered stage admission | `engine/packages/orchestrator/src/map-audit-admission.ts` |
| Operator-facing Map Audit Output V2 | `engine/packages/orchestrator/src/map-audit-output-v2.ts` |
| Audit obligations | `engine/packages/orchestrator/src/map-audit-obligations.ts` |
| Model-facing bounded task context | `engine/packages/orchestrator/src/map-audit-model-task.ts` |
| Work Session audit projection | `engine/packages/orchestrator/src/workflow/map-audit-work-session.ts` |
| Report candidate collection | `engine/packages/orchestrator/src/reporting/report-defect-collector.ts` |
| Bug review / approval | `engine/packages/bug-report/src/review.ts` |
| Repair admission | `engine/packages/orchestrator/src/repair/repair-admission-pipeline.ts` |

Human workflow owners:

- [Master Selected-Map Audit Workflow](../analysis/master-selected-map-audit-workflow.md)
- [Mandatory Gameplay Audit Procedure](../analysis/mandatory-audit-procedure.md)
- [Bug-Finding Coverage](../analysis/bug-finding-coverage.md)

## Knowledge access owners

```text
Router
→ docs/README.md + domain README

Catalog
→ tooling/repository/resource-catalog.mjs

Graph
→ tooling/repository/graph.mjs

Retrieval
→ `engine/packages/analysis-planner/src/retrieval.ts`
→ repository entrypoint: `tooling/repository/retrieve.ts`
→ section ranking: `engine/packages/analysis-planner/src/section-retrieval.ts`
→ repository lexical scoring: `tooling/repository/lexical-retrieval.mjs`

Context
→ `engine/packages/orchestrator/src/workflow/context-compiler.ts` + `resource-context.ts`
```

Catalog and Graph are derived navigation structures. They never replace the source/data owners listed above.

## Exact lookup rule

Do not expand this document back into a per-symbol or per-file database.

For an exact implementation question:

1. resolve the concern through the appropriate Router;
2. resolve registered resources through the Resource Catalog;
3. inspect the matching machine-readable ownership file;
4. search only the selected owner/module;
5. read the minimum source required to decide the question.

If a responsibility cannot be resolved through this path, fix ownership/routing metadata rather than adding another row of ad-hoc implementation trivia here.
