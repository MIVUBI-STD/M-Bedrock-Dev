# Virtual Clients — Static Readiness Freeze

Status: REMOTE_GITHUB source boundary. This document is not target-machine proof.

## Static-covered

The current source establishes these contracts without claiming Windows/VMware/Minecraft runtime acceptance:

- one Native Minecraft version authority with Base and Virtual lineage gates;
- bounded lifecycle admission owned by the backend;
- provider-state reconciliation for ambiguous lifecycle mutations where authoritative facts exist;
- fail-closed handling when destructive mutation outcomes cannot be proven;
- rollback isolation for multi-client start, stop and suspend flows;
- per-Virtual Guest Agent tokens rotated from inherited Base state;
- bounded Guest Agent request/response transport with request correlation;
- explicit Guest Agent status and launch protocol compatibility;
- loopback-only interactive launcher handoff;
- connection evidence separated from setup, sign-in and multiplayer readiness;
- resource ceiling separated from observed host working set and pressure;
- runtime schema downgrade protection;
- idempotent Guest Agent install/repair/uninstall lifecycle;
- bounded firewall policy for Guest Agent TCP 47831;
- trusted release identity, installer hash, Authenticode and provenance contracts;
- update staging without self-apply;
- privacy-bounded support evidence and Windows acceptance collector.

## Architecture freeze rule

Do not add another lifecycle manager, networking layer, retry framework, readiness state machine, credential mechanism, resource scheduler, or update executor without target-machine evidence that an existing owner cannot express the required behavior.

Source changes after this checkpoint should be limited to:
1. correctness defects with a concrete first owner;
2. contract/documentation drift;
3. security/privacy defects;
4. deterministic regression coverage for an existing contract; or
5. changes justified by LOCAL_WINDOWS / VMWARE / MINECRAFT acceptance evidence.

## Local proof required

The following remain intentionally unproven by source inspection:

- VMware Workstation can run Virtual-01, Virtual-02 and Virtual-03 concurrently on the target host;
- Native Minecraft Education plus all three Virtual Minecraft clients remain interactive concurrently;
- SYSTEM Guest Agent starts after guest boot and remains reachable;
- the per-user interactive launcher starts after Windows login and replaces stale processes correctly;
- Minecraft Education launches in the intended interactive Windows session;
- Microsoft authentication surfaces remain inside the correct Virtual and deep-link completion returns to that client;
- four distinct licensed accounts can coexist under the intended tenant/policy;
- QA_READY preserves the intended account/session state after reset;
- stop/start, suspend/resume and host reboot preserve each Virtual independently;
- actual CPU, RAM, disk and GPU behavior is acceptable with Native + three Virtuals;
- VMware 3D acceleration is usable in all three guests concurrently;
- NAT supports the required Native↔Virtual and Virtual↔Virtual multiplayer topology;
- disconnect/reconnect and suspend/resume multiplayer behavior is usable;
- Window Layout identifies and arranges the real Minecraft/VMware windows correctly;
- install/repair/uninstall scripts behave as designed on the canonical Windows guest;
- signed installer staging and release artifacts behave correctly on the target Windows machine.

## Acceptance entrypoint

Use `acceptance/windows/collect-acceptance.ps1` for machine evidence. A collected field is evidence only for what it directly observes. In particular:

- `connectionHealth=MINECRAFT_RUNNING` means a Minecraft process was observed;
- `networkMode` records a provider network configuration only when one was observed;
- multiplayer remains unproven until an actual multiplayer acceptance stage passes; there is no synthetic verification boolean.

Do not promote LOCAL proof from documentation, source tests, package smoke, or hosted CI.


## Build gate status

The static architecture freeze does not imply a successful package build. A source revision is eligible for Windows acceptance only after the canonical Virtual Clients Package Smoke workflow has executed against that revision and completed successfully.

Commits intentionally marked `[skip ci]` remain `STATIC_REVIEWED / BUILD_UNPROVEN` until an explicit non-skipped verification commit or equivalent canonical workflow execution covers the resulting source tree.

Do not translate absence of workflow failures into PASS when no workflow ran.


## Static security freeze

Security architecture is frozen at this checkpoint. Existing boundaries include bounded Guest Agent transport, per-Virtual tokens, fixed launch actions, runtime metadata redirection rejection, update URL/hash/signature/staging containment, privileged Guest Agent task verification, and signed release/package evidence.

Do not add a second authentication mechanism, privileged helper, firewall service, updater daemon, ACL framework or security database without target-machine evidence. Effective Windows ACLs, Scheduled Task ACLs, firewall enforcement, antivirus interaction, Windows session behavior and VMware guestinfo exposure remain LOCAL proof.
